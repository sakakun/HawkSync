## HawkSync

### What Is HawkSync?

HawkSync Server Manager is a comprehensive, feature-rich tool designed for managing game servers—particularly for Novalogic's Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. Built with modern .NET technologies, HawkSync provides server administrators with powerful real-time control, monitoring, and automation capabilities that go far beyond the original game's built-in management tools.
